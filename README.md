# Laravel Skill Test

## 1. Overview

Implement RESTful routes for a `Post` model using Laravel 12. Posts support **drafts**, **scheduled publishing**, and **authenticated user operations**.

## 2. Workflow

1. Clone this repository and set up the local environment.
2. Change the remote repository to your own public repository (do **not** delete commit history)
3. Implement the required features described below.
4. Push all changes to your public repository and let us know the repository URL.

## 3. Specifications

### General

- Follow Laravel 12 best practices and official documentation (https://laravel.com/docs/12.x)
- Write clear, meaningful commit messages with reasonable commit sizes
- View files are **not required**

### Post Status

- The `posts` table already exists.
- You are expected to understand how to determine whether a post is a draft, scheduled, or published by carefully examining the table structure, seed data, and business requirements.
- Scheduled posts do not require a cron job. They will be published automatically when the publish date comes.

### Authentication

- Use Laravel’s built-in **session & cookie-based authentication**
- Token-based systems (Sanctum, Passport, etc.) are not required

### 4-2. `posts.create`

- Only authenticated users can access this route
- Return the string `posts.create`

### 4-3. `posts.store`

- Only authenticated users can create new posts

- Return an appropriate response for a `POST` request

### 4-4. `posts.show`

- Return a JSON response in a format suitable for passing to views
- Return **404** if the post is a draft or scheduled

### 4-5. `posts.edit`
